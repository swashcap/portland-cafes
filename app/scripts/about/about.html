		<p>Portland Cafés is a fun side project by Portland-based developers and coffee enthusiasts <a href="http://www.onedrillion.com/">David LaChasse</a> and <a href="http://swashcap.com">Cory Reed</a>. The project began as an answer to the question “what coffee shops are open?” and quicky evolved into a complete listing of the city’s many cafés.</p>
		<p>The project’s source code is <a href="https://github.com/swashcap/portland-cafes">available on GitHub</a>. See a bug? Is a café missing? Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/swashcap/portland-cafes/issues/new">submit an issue</a> on the project.</p>
